      <p>Robots and robotic technology have been prominent within Japanese culture for some time. The term mecha/meka refers to both the real and science fiction appreciation for robotic technology, robots, machines, and hybrids. Meka can come in all shapes, forms, and sizes, often taking on humanoid forms, but they can also be vehicular or biomorphic (meaning combining mechanic and biological forms such as hybrids. The love for meka in Japan is tied closely with the country’s cultural appreciation and questioning of modern technology. It aims to explore what humanity is capable of, and what monsters may be created through the development of technology (Sone 77).</p>
      <p>The history of meka in Japan dates back as far as the 1600s, with the development of karakuri, which were small mechanical puppets used in Japanese entertainment (Gates 1). Around the time of World War I and II, the expansion of technology saw a new way of inspiration for Japanese culture, with meka gaining traction through manga such as Astro Boy and Tetsujin-28-Go (Bolton, Csicsery-Ronay, and Tatsumi 18). As the genre of science fiction continued to blossom due to the growth of modern technology, Japanese culture has idolized the potential that automation and robotics can open up for humanity.</p></br>

      <p>Meka also became an important addition to other developing franchises, such as with the development of the mechagodzilla that combined the love of Godzilla with the Japanese fascination with all things meka. Meka even began to infiltrate subcultures like the love for monsters, with the development of Digimon and other franchises that combined meka and animals into hybrid monsters. Meka is even capable with entering into the kawaii cultures, with the development of robots targeting female demographics, although this has been relatively rare as their target audiences tend to be more mutually exclusive. </p>
      <p>Nothing can be more indicative of the love for meka in Japan than the life-size Gundam robot that is being constructed in Yokohama, standing over 18 meters tall. Started in 2014, this project demonstrates the massive inspiration that anime meka can bring to reality, and how the concepts from science fiction can challenge the bounds of reality and push modern engineering to its limits. Gundam, one of the most popular meka franchises in the world, has sold over 450 million model kits around the world since 1980 (Gates 1). This franchise has inspired manga, anime shows and films, plastic models, computer games, toys, and practically all types of merchandise. </p></br></br>

      <p>Real-life functional meka are also popular and growing more noticeable. Battling robots are becoming a new type of sport both in Japan and around the world, with developments in both the functional and aesthetic features of these robots. As technology continues to grow and develop, the possibilities of these meka to come to life opening up even more doors for the culture to grow. This is a vital part of understanding both Japan’s history and its future. This subculture inspires the mind and asks questions about where humanity is going, all while representing the complex relationships between mankind and machines. Meka has a long history in Japanese culture, and modern technology will likely continue to inspire the Japanese culture surrounding meka and all things robotic.</p>
