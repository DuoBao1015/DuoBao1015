      <h2><a> Japanese pop culture Web Site group project</a></h2>

      <p>This is the final project, the purpose is to summarize and share the content learned this semester. Let more people know about this class and Japanese pop culture.</p>
      <p>Groups for Section A:</p>
      <p>Soot Sprites (Shelly, Fiona, Duo, Briana, Alyssa)</p>
	  <p>There is much we can learn about Japan from Japanese pop-culutre. Miku Hatsune teaches us about the progression 
	  of technology in Japan. From replicating vocals for singing to complex holigrams in order to hold performances 
	  performed by someone who isn't even real. She teaches the importance of collaborative effort in order to progress 
	  the bounds of technology, and in order to learn new skills through open-source culture. Miku Hatsune and the other
	  Vocaloids also emphasize the need to try and replicate pop-culture.</p>
                 <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                 <p>Duo Bao:</P>
                 <p>Since the 1990s, the influence of Japanese culture has expanded rapidly. From animation, music to fashion design, Japan's imprint is everywhere in the world. Japanese pop culture has received more and more attention. Young people from all over the world, especially in East Asian countries, are all deeply influenced by Japanese animation, computer games, film and television, and popular music.</p>
                 <p>First of all, Japanese pop culture comes from rich traditional culture. For example, the various monsters and ghosts recorded in Hyakki Yexing. One of the more famous is Kappa, whose image appears in many animations and documents. It is these rich stories that provide material for various animation stories in the future. With the changes in Japanese society, the image of Godzilla was born and was welcomed at the beginning of its birth. With the passage of time, it has become the largest IP. Although Toho has stopped this IP, it has the image of Godzilla has entered Hollywood and continues to grow. In addition to these monster series, those cute images that better reflect Japanese pop culture, such as Chibi Maruko, Crayon Shin-chan, Kumamoto, Kumamoto are the mascots of Kumamoto Prefecture, which will reflect the combination of cartoon characters and economic benefits., The life pattern in Crayon Shin-chan records a way of life of ordinary Japanese, which is a good publicity for Japanese so                        ciety and culture. In the end, I think it is the work of Mr. Miyazaki Hayao that reflects more thoughts. His works are worthy of reflection not only for Japan, but also for the whole world. This is a new height of Japanese culture. All of these popular cultures are the most important. The main thing is thought, and it is these thoughtful works that make Japanese popular culture popular.</p>
                 <p>Japanese anime is often more like a private expression of personal desire and entertainment. Its mature genre and wide range of subjects allow its potential audience to reach an extremely wide range. The relatively cheap production cost does not hinder its imagination comparable to Hollywood. His universal values and the discovery and exploration of universal human nature make it easier for the works to overcome cultural barriers. Through the sharing of social media in the Internet age, the reach of Japanese animation can be extended even wider.
