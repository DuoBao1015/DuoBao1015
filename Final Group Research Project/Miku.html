				"Miku Hatsune represents Japanese pop culture as she was originally 
				created in Japan and gained her initial popularity in Japan. She can 
				be considered pop culture due to the mass amount of media that is 
				centered around her.

				"Miku Hatsune is the mascot for the third version of the Yamaha Vocaloid 
				programs. She was the visual representation of the vocals that the program 
				created. Her overarching success led to the creation of more vocaloids 
				with mascots and expanded the bounds of what a mascot could be. Miku was 
				created to be a 16-year-old female and was initially released on August 31, 
				2007. Her most recent release/update was November 27th, 2020. Miku Hatsune 
				was never intended to be the virtual sensation that she is today. Miku was 
				originally intended to be 'the face of computer software that allowed users 
				to generate their own music, with her as a vessel'(Petrarca). Which is a 
				roundabout way of saying that she was just meant to be box art. She was 
				created to look the way she is to give the packaging a much more modern look 
				to catch the attention of potential buyers. Miku was purposely designed to 
				appear futuristic, as the company wanted to convey the idea that Vocaloid 
				programs were the next tool of the future for music design."

				"While Miku is the first internationally recognized virtual idol, she isn't 
				actually the first virtual idol. A virtual idol is an idol, aka musical 
				preformer, who isn't a real human being.The first virtual idol was Kyoko Date, 
				however, since she didn't become main stream she never got properly regonized
				as the first virtual idol. At this point you may be asking what a virtual idol 
				is. This is important to Japanese pop culture as it shows that in order to get
				regonized as a crutial part of pop culture, you must first be someone/something 
				that is instantly recognizable."

				"'The success of Hatsune Miku has spawned the creation of related virtual idols 
				such as China’s Luo Tianyi'(Rouse). But her success didn't just impact other 
				companies, it also impacted her own company. Due to Miku's success, all the 
				new Vocaloid programs that came after her had their own character, or had a 
				reboot character. These new virtual idols in the vocaloid franchise haven't
				yet reached the same level of popularity as Miku, but are loved by the vocaloid
				fans. This further emphasizes the pop-culture aspect of Miku as it shows the 
				reproduction side of pop-culture, where when a company has a successful pop-culture
				product, they will do anything in their power to create something similar with 
				the same level of popularity. These additional Vocaloids can also be considered 
				Japanese since they were produced at the Yamaha facility in Japan."

				<p>
				"Miku is more than Japanese pop-culture though, she has also had a large impact 
				on open-source culture. The success of Miku can mostly be attributed to, 
				'amateur self-published fan creations based on famous characters'(Halo, 3). 
				Which is a prime example of open source culture. Open source culture is formed 
				around the concept that information should be free. Before Miku this concept was 
				mostly used in terms of Computer Science, to allow others to alter and fix your
				code in the name of free exchange. Open source allows people to learn from both 
				the successes and failures of others. However, when Miku started to be used in 
				an open source way, it opened the doors for the open source community. As it 
				became more popular to create your own Miku art based off the open licencing
				on her image, it became more popular to use the open source mindset on other 
				pieces of art, allowing for the additional creation of pop-art, as well as pop-
				culture. For example, ever since the copyright for worm on a string died, it has 
				regrown in popularity due to people creating their own worm on a string art, such 
				as making giant worm on a strings."
