    <h1>Japanese Pop Culture：<br> Style Beyond Gender</h1>

    <section class="project project-forms">
      <h2>Style Beyond Gender</h2>
      <h3>Author: Alyssa Crawford</h3>

      <p>Fashion & style trends are an important element of Japanese pop culture. Next to modern Euro-American fashion, modern Japanese fashion (especially among young people) tends to stand out, being far more visually striking, expressive, and impactful. One of the key elements through which Japanese style stands apart is its genderless quality. Japan has a long history of gender non-conformity, most notably through theatrical cross-dressing. Today, androgyny in both men & women is looked upon as desirable, fashionable, and attractive. </p>

        <h3>ジェンダーレス系 (Genderless Kei)</h3>

        <div class="project-thumb">
          <a href="https://lab.fril.jp/frillab-1283" target="_blank"><img src="img/genderlesskei.jpg"></a>
        </div>
	<p> When you search online for information about androgynous Japanese fashion, you're likely to get many results about a current trend known as "ジェンダーレス系" ("jendāresu kei," genderless style). In general, it refers to Japanese men who don't dress or present stereotypically masculine (however, "ジェンダーレス女子" or "genderless girls" do exist). The style itself is very diverse, and can refer to many different kinds of self-expression outside of traditional expectations. It has influences in Harajuku street fashion, rock & visual kei, K-Pop style, American fashion of the '80s/'90s, kawaii culture, drag queen style, avant-garde runway fashion, and historical "cross-dressing," among others (Robertson).</p>
	<p> Common elements of this style include colored or long hair, well-maintained skin, soft makeup, goth or pastel color palettes, "kawaii" accessories, feminine bags, tight-fitting jeans (accentuates a thin, androgynous figure), and loose-fitting tops (hides a masculine figure) ("TV・各メディア..."). However, these styles can range from subtle to extravagant. </p>
        <p> It is important to note that "genderless" in this context is not necessarily a gender identity, and men who follow these trends are not always members of the LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, etc.) community--however, the acceptance of androgynous fashion in Japan has likely resulted from greater acceptance & awareness of the LGBTQ+ community, and vice versa. While someone who wears "genderless fashion" may very well be a straight, cisgender man, they still display a more modern & inclusive view of gender, in which one's expression & identity are separate entities ("TV・各メディア...", Robertson).</p>

        <h3>美少年 (Bishōnen)</h3>

        <div class="project-thumb">
          <a href="https://ouran.fandom.com/wiki/Tamaki_Suoh" target="_blank"><img src="img/tamaki.jpg"></a>
        </div>
        <p> Bishōnen, a combination of "美" ("bi", beautiful) and "少年" ("shōnen", adolescent boys), refers to a kind of genderless beauty of young men and boys that is admired in many parts of Asia. Like the term "shōjo" acts for young women, "shōnen" or "bishōnen" is akin to an androgynous gender category for youth who aren't quite mature enough to be "male" (Nicolae). </p>
	<p> The term was once used to describe onnagata and wakashū-gata (adolescent kabuki roles), as well as more effeminate young men in homoerotic contexts. It grew to popular use in the era of visual kei, as a way to describe the alluring, punk/rock, androgynous musicians. However, the term is now most often associated with male characters in shōjo manga/anime, who often appear delicate, slim, and "pretty" in a way that is not traditionally masculine. Looking at Japanese media produced for adolescent girls, it doesn't take long find one of these fictional "pretty-boys" (Nicolae). </p>
	<p> This term could also very well be applied to those who display "genderless kei" in real life. There are many other terms that describe men who break gender roles, such as "草食男子" ("sōshoku danshi", herbivore men), "ハイカラー" ("haikarā", Euro-influenced high-collar style), "フェミ男" ("femi-otoko", feminine man), "オトメン" ("otomen", men with feminine interests), イクメン ("ikumen", child-rearing men), and more (Nicolae, Robertson).</p>

        <h3>歌舞伎と女形 (Kabuki & Onnagata)</h3>

        <div class="project-thumb">
          <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%88%9E%E8%B8%8A_%E9%95%B7%E5%94%84%E3%80%8C%E9%B7%BA%E5%A8%98%E3%80%8D.jpg#/media/File:日本舞踊_長唄「鷺娘」.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/sagimusume.jpg"></a>
        </div>
        <p> A major historical counterpart to bishōnen & genderless kei are the 女形 ("onnagata", women-roles) of kabuki theatre. Kabuki theatre has been, for most of its existence, performed solely by men. Some of the most esteemed roles are that of the onnagata, who perform in women's clothing and hyper-feminine makeup (Isaka, Robertson). </p>
	<p> At first a risqué commoners' past-time akin to prostitution, in which beautiful men in women's roles were often lusted over,  kabuki came to be embraced as a form of traditional Japanese art. And yet, it also remains today a fantastical performance, with its unique form of queer-esque gender-bending at the forefront. This display of male femininity is treasured and highly esteemed as a refined art form, as the ability to perfectly play this gender role is regarded as an exceptional skill. Many theorize that embracing this somewhat "genderless" presentation helped pave the way for acceptance of modern "genderless" and LGBTQ+ people in Japan (Isaka). </p>

        <h3>宝塚歌劇団と男役 (Takarazuka Revue & Otokoyaku)</a></h3>

        <div class="project-thumb">
          <a href="https://cdn.mainichi.jp/vol1/2020/07/18/20200718p2a00m0et003000p/9.jpg?1" target="_blank"><img src="img/takarazuka.jpg"></a>
        </div>
        <p> When inquiring about Japanese androgynous style, you will likely come across far more results about men than women. There are indeed, however, Japanese women who display masculine or androgynous styles. Some relevant terms include "男装" ("dansou", female crossdresser), "ボーイッシュ" ("bōisshu", boyish), "ジェンダーレス女子" ("jendāresu-joshi", genderless girls) and, in the context of theatre, 男役 ("otokoyaku", male role). Most notable are the otokoyaku of the Takarazuka Revue, a famous theatre troop with an all-female cast, who are adored by many Japanese women (Deutsch). </p>
	<p> The Takarazuka Revue consists of five troupes: 花組 ("hana-gumi", Flower Troupe), 月組 ("tsuki-gumi", Moon Troupe), 雪組 ("yuki-gumi", Snow Troupe), 星組 ("hoshi-gumi", Star Troupe), 宙組 ("sora-gumi", Cosmos Troupe). Each troupe has a トップスター (Top Star) who plays lead male roles, and a トップ娘役 (Top Musumeyaku) who plays lead female roles (<i>Takarazuka Revue...</i>).
	<p> The "Top Stars" in particular have a large fanbase of captivated women, who purchase official merchandise covered with the otokoyaku's faces. Many of these fans are in relationships with men, and do not consider themselves members of the LGBTQ+ community, despite the fact that these performances depict "heterosexual" romances... sans men. While there are inescapable queer implications, the Takarazuka Revue is still, in essence, make-believe. It subverts gender expectations in a socially acceptable way, without creating or implying an alternative gender identity or sexuality (Deutsch). </p>
