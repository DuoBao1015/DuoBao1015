There are cacti, flowers, so many butterflies, and yes, all kinds of water (raging river, big dam.)  People at the front desk were super nice and helpful with giving advice on where to go, and there were rangers spread throughout the canyon to give guidance as well. I was so blown away by the natural beauty of this terrain, at the greenery of it all. I have never seen a sky so blue.",

You could even take a stage coach ride and get held up by bandits. Take a train ride with the kids around the studio or drive a small car around a track. Also, they had an area where you can pan for gold and many more things to do. Hopefully, they reopen soon and bring back all of the fun!",
